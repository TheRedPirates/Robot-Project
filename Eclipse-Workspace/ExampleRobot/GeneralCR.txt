* add .gitignore (AND removing files irrelevant to it)
* the base folder of the repository needs to be the base folder of the project, NOT the entire workspace!

Good work so far, team! look for comments with the word "CR" on the java code and rewrite.
Don't forget to remove the comments when you're down. Also, remove other unnecessary comments.
Notice that since the code often has similar parts, CR written for one class applies for other similar
classes, even if it's not written there. We'll work on cutting down repeating code soon, and of course,
keep working on our autonomous code.
